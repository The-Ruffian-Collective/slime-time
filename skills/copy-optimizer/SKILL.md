# Copy Optimizer

A skill for ruthlessly evaluating existing copy and rewriting it with modern, conversion-focused techniques that actually work.

## Philosophy

Most website copy is shite. It's either:
- Written by the founder who's too close to the product
- Generic marketing waffle that says nothing
- Feature-focused when it should be benefit-driven
- Using 2010s frameworks in a 2025 world
- Boring, safe, and utterly forgettable

This skill transforms weak copy into sharp, contemporary messaging that converts.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Evaluating existing website or landing page copy
- User shares a URL or paste of current copy
- Optimizing marketing materials (emails, ads, social posts)
- User says "improve my copy", "audit my website", "make this better"
- Copy needs to align with brand voice while improving performance
- Testing new messaging approaches

## The Evaluation Framework

### 1. First Impression Audit (0-3 seconds)
The make-or-break moment when someone lands on the page.

**Evaluate:**
- **Clarity Score** (1-10): Can a 12-year-old understand what you do in 3 seconds?
- **Relevance Score** (1-10): Does it speak to the visitor's immediate problem?
- **Distinction Score** (1-10): Could this headline work for a competitor?
- **Emotional Hook** (1-10): Does it create an emotional response?

**Red Flags:**
- Headlines that start with "Welcome to..."
- Generic value props ("We help businesses succeed")
- Jargon in the hero section
- No clear indication of what the product/service actually does
- Missing the "for whom" element

### 2. Message Hierarchy Analysis
Does the copy guide the reader through a logical journey?

**Evaluate:**
- **Hero Section**: One clear promise or problem identification
- **Sub-hero**: The "how" or "what makes us different"
- **Benefits Section**: Outcome-driven, not feature-driven
- **Social Proof**: Strategically placed, specific not generic
- **CTA Clarity**: Clear next step with low friction

**Structure Test:**
- Remove all formatting and read top to bottom
- Does it build a compelling case?
- Is there a clear problem → solution → transformation arc?

### 3. Voice & Tone Assessment

**Identify Current Voice:**
- Corporate/Professional
- Casual/Conversational
- Technical/Expert
- Aspirational/Inspirational
- Irreverent/Edgy
- Educational/Helpful

**Evaluate Consistency:**
- Does voice match target audience?
- Is tone consistent across sections?
- Does personality show or is it generic?
- Brand voice vs. conversion voice balance

### 4. Conversion Psychology Check

**Scan for:**
- **Specificity**: Vague claims vs. concrete outcomes
- **Friction Points**: Unnecessary form fields, unclear CTAs, too many choices
- **Trust Signals**: Social proof placement and quality
- **Urgency/Scarcity**: Present and authentic vs. artificial
- **Risk Reversal**: Guarantees, free trials, easy cancellation
- **Value Clarity**: Can visitor articulate the value in one sentence?

**Psychological Triggers Present:**
- [ ] Social proof (testimonials, numbers, logos)
- [ ] Authority (credentials, press, experts)
- [ ] Scarcity (limited availability, urgency)
- [ ] Reciprocity (free value upfront)
- [ ] Loss aversion (what they'll miss out on)
- [ ] Identity/aspiration (who they'll become)

### 5. Modern Copy Standards

**2025+ Best Practices:**
- **Outcome-driven**: Focuses on results, not features
- **Conversation-starter**: Poses questions or challenges assumptions
- **Pattern-interrupt**: Breaks expected formats
- **Specificity**: Numbers, names, concrete examples
- **Story-driven**: Uses narrative not bullet points
- **Skimmable**: Designed for 2-second attention spans
- **Mobile-first**: Hierarchy works on small screens
- **Accessibility**: Clear language, proper contrast, readable

**Dated Approaches to Flag:**
- "Best-in-class" and other empty superlatives
- Feature comparison tables above the fold
- "About Us" focus instead of customer focus
- Generic stock photos instead of real people/products
- Long paragraphs without visual breaks
- Passive voice and complex sentence structure

## The Rewrite Process

### Stage 1: Diagnostic Brief

Before rewriting, create a structured brief:

```
COPY AUDIT: [Product/Service Name]

CURRENT STATE:
- Clarity Score: X/10
- Relevance Score: X/10  
- Distinction Score: X/10
- Emotional Hook: X/10

PRIMARY ISSUES:
1. [Specific problem]
2. [Specific problem]
3. [Specific problem]

TARGET AUDIENCE: [Who this is for]
CORE PROBLEM: [What pain point we're solving]
UNIQUE ANGLE: [What makes this different]
DESIRED ACTION: [What we want visitors to do]

RECOMMENDED APPROACH: [Strategy for rewrite]
```

### Stage 2: Strategic Choices

**Choose the Right Framework:**

**Problem-Agitate-Solve (PAS)**
- Best for: Clear, painful problems with obvious solutions
- Structure: Identify problem → Make it worse → Present solution
- Example: "Your restaurant staff keeps messing up orders [Problem]. Every mistake costs you money and reputation [Agitate]. AI Chef Guy's smart order system catches errors before they reach the kitchen [Solve]."

**Before-After-Bridge (BAB)**
- Best for: Transformation stories, lifestyle changes
- Structure: Current state → Desired state → How we get there
- Example: "Tired of cooking the same boring meals [Before]? Imagine having restaurant-quality dishes every night [After]. MenuCraft makes it possible with AI-powered meal planning [Bridge]."

**Features-Advantages-Benefits (FAB)**
- Best for: Technical products needing translation
- Structure: What it is → What that means → Why it matters
- Example: "AI-powered menu analysis [Feature] spots pricing mistakes in seconds [Advantage] so you stop leaving money on the table [Benefit]."

**AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)**
- Best for: Long-form sales pages, email sequences
- Structure: Hook → Build interest → Create desire → Clear CTA
- Traditional but effective when executed well

**Story-Driven**
- Best for: Founder-driven brands, unique origin stories
- Structure: Situation → Complication → Resolution → Application
- Most engaging but requires authentic story

### Stage 3: Hero Section Rewrite

The hero section is 80% of the battle. Get this right first.

**Formula Options:**

**Outcome-First:**
"[Specific Result] in [Timeframe] or [Guarantee]"
- "Restaurant-quality menu planning in 5 minutes or your money back"

**Problem-First:**
"Finally, a [solution] that [addresses frustration]"
- "Finally, a food photography tool that doesn't need a £5k camera"

**Aspiration-First:**
"[Who you help] use [product] to [transformation]"
- "Independent restaurants use MenuCraft to compete with chain efficiency"

**Challenge-First:**
"Everyone says [common belief]. We say [contrarian truth]."
- "Everyone says you need a big marketing budget. We say you need better copy."

**Elements to Include:**
- Specific outcome or problem (not generic)
- Target audience clearly identified
- Differentiator that matters
- Clear next step
- Visual hierarchy that guides the eye

### Stage 4: Supporting Sections

**Benefits Section:**
Transform features into outcomes using this pattern:
- Feature: "What it is"
- Advantage: "What that means"  
- Benefit: "Why it matters to YOU"

**Social Proof Strategy:**
- Specific numbers beat generic testimonials
- Names and faces beat anonymous quotes
- Recent and relevant beats old and impressive
- Video testimonials beat written ones
- Problem-specific beats general praise

**CTA Optimization:**
- Button text: Outcome-focused, not "Submit" or "Buy Now"
- Above button: Address the last objection
- Around CTA: Remove competing links and distractions
- Multiple CTAs: Same action, different contexts
- Friction reducer: "No credit card required", "Cancel anytime"

### Stage 5: Voice Calibration

**Brand Voice Spectrum:**

**Formal → Casual:**
- "We provide solutions" → "We help" → "We've got you"
- "Utilize our platform" → "Use our tool" → "Try this"
- "Facilitate success" → "Help you win" → "Make you look good"

**Technical → Accessible:**
- "Proprietary algorithm" → "Smart system" → "Does the thinking for you"
- "Machine learning model" → "AI that learns" → "Gets smarter over time"
- "Optimization engine" → "Makes things better" → "Fixes the annoying stuff"

**Corporate → Human:**
- "Our mission is to empower" → "We help people" → "We make your life easier"
- "Stakeholder alignment" → "Getting everyone on the same page" → "No more confused teams"
- "Best-in-class" → "Really good" → "The one you'll actually use"

**Choose voice based on:**
- Industry norms (finance vs. food)
- Audience sophistication (CFOs vs. consumers)
- Brand positioning (premium vs. accessible)
- Founder personality (if personal brand)

## Advanced Techniques

### Pattern Interrupts

**Unexpected Formats:**
- Start with "No." or "Stop."
- Use questions instead of statements
- Subvert industry clichés
- Break the fourth wall ("This headline is probably too honest...")

### Specificity Triggers

Replace vague claims with concrete details:
- "Fast" → "In 47 seconds"
- "Many customers" → "2,847 Glasgow restaurants"
- "Improve results" → "3x more bookings in first month"
- "Easy to use" → "5-minute setup, no training needed"

### Objection Pre-emption

Address concerns before they're asked:
- "Sounds expensive?" → Price anchor
- "Too good to be true?" → Case study
- "Tried this before?" → What's different
- "Not technical?" → "No coding required"

### Progressive Disclosure

Reveal value in layers:
1. Hook with the outcome
2. Build credibility
3. Explain the mechanism
4. Show the proof
5. Remove friction
6. Prompt action

## Evaluation Criteria for Rewrites

**Self-Check Questions:**
- Could this headline work for a competitor? (If yes, start over)
- Can someone explain the value in one sentence? (If no, simplify)
- Does it address a real pain point? (If no, research deeper)
- Would the target audience use these words? (If no, adjust voice)
- Is there a clear, low-friction next step? (If no, fix CTA)
- Does it create an emotional response? (If no, add stakes)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**In Evaluation:**
- Being too nice to bad copy
- Focusing on style over substance
- Missing mobile/skim reading issues
- Ignoring target audience mismatch
- Not challenging weak value props

**In Rewriting:**
- Making it about the product, not the customer
- Using industry jargon to sound smart
- Over-promising or creating unrealistic expectations
- Copying competitor messaging
- Losing authentic brand voice for "best practices"
- Writing for yourself, not the target audience

## Quality Standards

A rewrite is ready when:
- ✅ 3-second rule: Visitor knows what this is and who it's for
- ✅ Skim test: Can get the value reading headings only
- ✅ Distinction test: Couldn't work for any competitor
- ✅ Objection test: Addresses top 3 buyer concerns
- ✅ Action test: Clear next step with minimal friction
- ✅ Voice test: Sounds like a human, not a marketing department

## Tool Usage

**For Evaluations:**
1. Read the page (via browser tools or user-provided copy)
2. Take screenshots to assess visual hierarchy
3. Analyze competitor pages for context
4. Search for industry benchmarks if needed

**For Research:**
- Find target audience language (forums, reviews)
- Study high-performing competitors
- Identify market positioning gaps
- Gather social proof examples

**For Implementation:**
- Create new copy in clean markdown
- Provide before/after comparisons
- Include HTML if user needs it
- Create A/B test variants

## Success Metrics

Track these to validate improvements:
- Time on page (should increase if compelling)
- Scroll depth (are they reading?)
- CTA click rate (clearer = higher)
- Form completions (reduced friction = more conversions)
- Bounce rate (relevance matters)
- Qualitative feedback ("This actually makes sense now")

## Final Note

The best copy is:
- Clear > Clever
- Specific > Impressive  
- Simple > Sophisticated
- Honest > Hyped
- Useful > Beautiful

Focus on the reader's needs, not your own desire to sound smart. Write like you talk (if you talk to customers). Cut the waffle. Make every word earn its place.

Now go make some killer copy.
